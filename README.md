### Basic Usage

Define your view routes.

final Routes routes = {
  '/': (_) => HomePage(),
  '/profile': (_) => ProfilePage()
};
```

Create a `ViewRouter` and add to your `MaterialApp` as the `onGenerateRoute` callback.

```dart

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My App',
      onGenerateRoute: ViewRouter(routes),
      initialRoute: '/',
    );
  }
}
```

Navigate using the navigator.

```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/profile');
```
